# CyberPatriot Scoring Report
An unofficial practice scoring report for CyberPatriot competition practice.

Developed in C# and WPF, the idea of this project is to provide the CyberPatriot community with an open source scoring program. Being open source, additions can be easily added and worked on by the community.

I, Stephen White, am also a competitor in CyberPatriot and CyberTitan. This is my first public project so any feedback is greatly appreciated.

This project is a work in progress and although has been tested within Windows 10 for its current features, many features are planned to be added in the near future. I have not tested the Scoring Report on any other operating systems. If you have issues on different operating systems, please open a ticket and I'll do my best to find a solution.

If you have any suggestions, open a ticket tagged as suggestion and it will be added to the todo list.

If anything is unclear and needs better explanation, feel free to ask. I hope the documentation here will be enough to explain. I have worked to comment nearly all the code to help explain aspects of this project to those just learning of this project.
